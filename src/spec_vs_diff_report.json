  "summary": "Theme tokens in index.css were updated to a blue/green palette and multiple components/pages now use primary/secondary/accent tokens, but the diff does not provide evidence that the actual logo asset file was replaced, and some key gradients still use hard-coded Tailwind blue/green classes rather than theme tokens. Several non-requested UI/content changes also appear (e.g., calendar behavior changes, expanded clinic/services/footer content).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-12",
      "requirement": "Replace the current site logo image used throughout the app with the newly uploaded logo image, keeping the logo exactly as-is with its white background (no transparency), and ensure no instances of the previous logo remain.",
      "reason": "The UI references the logo path, but the diff summary shows no static asset change or removal/replacement of the previous logo image. Without an updated file under frontend/public/assets/generated (or equivalent), there is no evidence the newly uploaded logo binary was actually applied, nor that old logo instances were eliminated.",

      "id": "REQ-13",
      "requirement": "Replace hard-coded blues/greens that materially conflict with the updated palette with theme tokens so future palette changes propagate consistently across Landing, Book Appointment, and Staff pages.",
      "reason": "Key sections still use hard-coded Tailwind gradient color classes (e.g., from-blue-50, via-blue-100, to-green-100, from-green-50) rather than theme tokens (e.g., bg-primary/bg-secondary or CSS-variable-driven utilities), so palette changes may not fully propagate via the updated global tokens.",

    {
      "description": "Calendar/availability behavior changes (e.g., calendar picker disabling Sundays) and explicit time-slot scheduling UI details beyond theme/logo updates.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest explicitly lists as non-goals adding new features such as a calendar/availability system or new appointment workflow steps; the diff summary indicates calendar-related behavior/styling changes not required for logo/theme alignment.",

      "reason": "Non-goals state not to change clinic details content (doctor details, phone, timings, address, services) unless required for the logo/theme update; the diff shows substantial clinic details/footer content structures and lists that are not directly tied to swapping the logo or updating theme tokens.",
