  "summary": "The implementation successfully applies Vijaya Children's Clinic branding to public-facing pages with comprehensive color scheme updates, doctor credentials display, service icons, contact information, and Tamil/English taglines. Staff portal functionality is preserved. However, there is one backend modification that violates constraints, and evidence of service icons in actual implementation is unclear from truncated files.",
