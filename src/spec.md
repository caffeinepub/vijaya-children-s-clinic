# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the public-facing website with Vijaya Children's Clinic branding from uploaded images while preserving all staff portal functionality.

**Planned changes:**
- Extract and implement the Vijaya Children's Clinic logo (cyan/green heart with figures) from uploaded images throughout the public website
- Apply cyan (#00BCD4), green (#4CAF50), and blue (#2196F3) color scheme to public-facing pages only
- Update landing page with complete clinic information: doctor's credentials (Dr. K. Manicka Vinayagar M.B.B.S, M.D, Reg.No: 152853), services with icons (Newborn Care, Vaccination, Fever, Nebulization, Growth Monitoring), contact number (93637 16343), timings (Mon-Sat 7 PM-9 PM, Sundays by appointment), and address (No.1, 1st street, Balaji Nagar, Anakaputhur, Chennai - 600 070)
- Display Tamil tagline 'குழந்தை நலனே எங்கள் முதன்மை' and English tagline 'Growing Healthy Futures'
- Preserve all existing staff portal functionality including authentication, appointment management, filtering, search, and status updates

**User-visible outcome:** The public website will display professional Vijaya Children's Clinic branding with complete clinic information, while staff can continue using the portal without any changes to functionality.
